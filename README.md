# AI-and-Card-Games

This project was assigned by __Dr. Philip Kirlin__. 
Dr. Kirlin provided the framework for _sortedList_. 

This program implements a doubly-linked list that maintains a list of integers in sorted order. It then uses that data structure to develop an AI program to play a card game. I programmed the _EricHalfBeePlayer_ that scored extra credit since it won the most games against other AI players in the class.    

It requires _stdlib.jar_ which was provided by Dr. Kirlin. 

__To Run:__
1. Download the project 
2. Open the project on IntelliJ
3. Run the 'NoThanksRunner.java' file 
<br> *The output is how often my AI player won against others. <\br>
